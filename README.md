# CPU Scheduling Algorithms Simulator

# Overview
This project simulates core CPU scheduling algorithms used in operating systems. It helps visualize how processes are scheduled and executed, and shows how different strategies affect performance metrics like waiting time and turnaround time.

# Features
- First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Priority Scheduling
- Round Robin Scheduling
- Calculation of waiting and turnaround times
- Clear visualization of execution order

# How to Run
1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Compile the source code using your compiler or IDE.
3. Run the executable file.
4. Select a scheduling algorithm to simulate and follow the prompts.

# Purpose
This simulator is created for educational purposes to demonstrate how different CPU scheduling techniques work and to compare their efficiencies.
